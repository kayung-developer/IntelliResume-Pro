## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Simulations

*   **No Backend Server:** All data (user info, resumes, settings) is stored in the browser's Local Storage. This means:
    *   Data is specific to the browser and device you are using.
    *   Data is not synced across different browsers or devices.
    *   Clearing browser data will erase all saved resumes and user information.
*   **AI is Simulated:** The "AI" features are designed to mimic the behavior of AI tools but use pre-defined rules, templates, and simple text processing. **They do not connect to any real external AI APIs (like OpenAI, etc.).**
*   **User Authentication is Simulated:** The login/registration system is basic, stores usernames in Local Storage, and does not involve secure password handling or a real database.
*   **Premium Upgrade is Simulated:** Clicking the "Upgrade" button simulates a premium subscription; no actual payment is processed.
*   **PDF Download Quality:** Relies on the browser's built-in "Print to PDF" functionality, so the output quality and layout fidelity can vary between browsers.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is in place, but it may not cover all edge cases.

## üöÄ Potential Future Enhancements

*   Additional resume templates.
*   More sophisticated AI simulation logic and a wider variety of suggestions.
*   Option to import resume data from a JSON file.
*   A "quick-fill" or "example" button to populate the resume with sample data.
*   (Major) Integration with a simple backend for real user accounts and cloud-based data storage.
*   (Major) Connection to actual AI APIs for genuine AI-powered content generation (would require API keys and backend infrastructure).
